- 😄 Pronouns: She/her

- ⭐⭐ Starstruck by the self-driving cars in 2019, I decided to transition to Computer Science and choose it as my career. I am a ML/AI - Software development aspirant. I firmly believe in the saying by Morgan Harper Nichols “There is a reason I am here, and that reason is bigger than me. So I will carry on with great faith beyond what I can see, in pursuit of bold courage on the adventure of the journey.” and thereby I am walking towards the journey with my optimism and quixotic behaviour. I am quite well-versed with Python and have been practising the thrill of using my programming skills to solve problems in creative ways.

- Have experience in Technical content writing/documentation and interned in Python.

- Started with competitive programming in 2021. Good at problem solving in Python as well as well-versed in Python data structures. Codechef:- https://www.codechef.com/users/ria99

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence algorithms as well as Optimization methods for Software engineering. Would love some help and guidance for the same.

- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Machine learning projects related to a data structure search engine I'm planning to make. If you're interested please reach out to me.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I am also planning to pursue higher studies in Artificial Intelligence and desirous to improve and enhance my software development, Machine Learning and statistics skills as time is passing and hope to achieve my ambitions soon.
